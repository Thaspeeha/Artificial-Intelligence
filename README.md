# Artificial-Intelligence

This project explores foundational concepts in **Artificial Intelligence**, including **generative AI**, **PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors)** for intelligent agents, and **search algorithms**. A key focus was on analyzing and implementing search strategies for a smart home assistant.



## 🧠 Project Overview

- 🔍 Researched **Generative AI** and its applications in intelligent systems
- 🏠 Applied the **PEAS framework** to model a Smart Home Assistant agent
- 🧮 Analyzed classic **search algorithms**:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
  - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- 🧑‍💻 **Implemented a BFS algorithm** using Python in Visual Studio Code



## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Libraries:** None (pure Python implementation)  
- **Platform:** Git & GitHub for version control  



## 📌 Key Components

### 🔹 Generative AI Research
- Studied principles behind generative models like ChatGPT and image generators

### 🔹 PEAS Framework
- Modeled a smart assistant with:
  - **Performance**: User satisfaction, task completion rate
  - **Environment**: Home devices, rooms, user preferences
  - **Actuators**: Voice output, device control modules
  - **Sensors**: Voice input, motion detection, temperature sensors

### 🔹 Search Algorithm Analysis
| Algorithm | Description | Optimal | Complete |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Depth-First | Explores depth-wise first | ❌ | ❌ |
| Breadth-First | Explores all nodes level-by-level | ✅ | ✅ |
| Uniform-Cost | Expands least-cost node | ✅ | ✅ |
| Iterative Deepening | DFS with increasing depth | ✅ | ✅ |
